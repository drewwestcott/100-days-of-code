# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed some code I have been putting off on my watchOS project.

**Thoughts** I've have a pretty good functioning App with several bugs in it. I would say I am at that 80% done with the feeling like the next 20% will take as long as the first 80 did. Today's hour gave me the excuse to sit down and start coding on the project again. I have sorted two issues out.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More of the 20% work for my watchOS project and started investigating alogithms exercises (today's from weheartswift).

**Thoughts** For the first exercise on weheartswift I was going to iterate over the string and take each letter in turn to append to a new string, then I remembered seeing swifts array reverse() method. So started down that line instead. The second exercise I coded in a basic fashion and satisfied all the tests. However, the solution was an much more elegant way to code it.

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a couple more alogithms exercises (today's from weheartswift).

**Thoughts** Today has been interesting. I managed to code the exercises quite easily and got very close to the suggested solution, with my own code feeling slightly more refined. The second exercise on palindrome landscape took me a while to understand the brief. My first try did not satisfy the tests, but after reading the hints a couple of time I managed to satisfy the test and like my code.

### Day 4: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a couple more  exercises (today's again from weheartswift).

**Thoughts** Wow, I had to think about this one. I nearly wrote code to test all numbers up to i each time, but after reviewing the idea Prime Numbers realised I could use square roots in the equation.

### Day 5: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Debugging. 

**Thoughts** Stuck with a tutoiral I had been following outside of hour of code. Decided to try and debug the 'selector sent to instance bug' so I can continue with the tutorials. Good practice working through break points and google searches.
