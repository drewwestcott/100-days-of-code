# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed some code I have been putting off on my watchOS project.

**Thoughts** I've have a pretty good functioning App with several bugs in it. I would say I am at that 80% done with the feeling like the next 20% will take as long as the first 80 did. Today's hour gave me the excuse to sit down and start coding on the project again. I have sorted two issues out.
